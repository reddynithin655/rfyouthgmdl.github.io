  <p>
    RF Youth GMDL is a youth-led organization formed with the aim of
    serving society and supporting people in need. Our group believes
    that youth have the power to bring positive change through unity,
    responsibility, and compassion.

  <p>
    We actively participate in social service activities such as
    awareness programs, community support initiatives, cleanliness
    drives, and volunteer-based services.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our goal is to inspire young people to contribute their time and
    energy towards building a better and more responsible society.
