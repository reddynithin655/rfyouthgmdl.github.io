  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    Royal Friends Gummadidala is a youth-driven group based in the village
    of Gummadidala. Our group was formed with the purpose of serving society
    and bringing positive change through unity and social responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe that youth have the strength and energy to support community
    development, help people in need, and inspire others through action.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through various social service activities, we aim to create awareness,
    support underprivileged individuals, and contribute to the overall
    well-being of society.
